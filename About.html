        <img src="Images/Topher.jpg" alt="Owner" class="Topher">
        <span>"My name is Topher Bell and I climb. I started climbing, in 2006, on a very small wall tucked into the corner of a gymnasium at ISU. I came home for the summer, bought my first pair of 
            climbing shoes, and found a local gym called Climb Time Towers. As a child, climbing the walls at Galyan’s had always intrigued me. However, living in Indiana made rock climbing seem 
            like a pipe dream reserved for children lucky enough to grow up out west. It was the same way I new I would never be a surfer because that was only for people who lived on the coast. 
            Little did I know that 250 miles away, the Red River Gorge had already been discovered and was being bolted and developed."</span>
